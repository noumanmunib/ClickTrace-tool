Yes, sharing the tool on **GitHub** is a great idea! It allows the professor (and others) to easily review, test, and possibly contribute to the project. Below, I've written a clear **README.md** file for your project that you can use in your GitHub repository.

# ClickTrace Tool

ClickTrace is a JavaScript static analysis tool designed to find **all possible sequences of function calls** triggered after a user clicks an app button. The tool builds a **call graph** and recursively explores every possible function call path. It's especially useful for analyzing JavaScript applications, both simple and complex, including those built using the **MVC architecture**.

## Features

- **Static Analysis**: Parses JavaScript files to build a call graph and explore all potential execution paths.
- **Multiple File Support**: Handles complex applications with multiple JavaScript files.
- **Supports Modern JavaScript**: Handles ES6+ features like arrow functions, class methods, and modules (import/export).
- **Call Graph Generation**: Outputs a call graph showing all functions and their respective calls.
- **Sequence Generation**: Generates all possible function call sequences, not just runtime execution paths.

## How It Works

The tool:
1. **Parses JavaScript files** using the Acorn parser.
2. **Builds a function call graph** by analyzing function declarations and function calls.
3. **Recursively explores** all possible call sequences based on the call graph.
4. Outputs the call graph and all possible function sequences in the console.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** (version 14 or higher)
- **NPM** (comes with Node.js)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/noumanmunib/ClickTrace-tool.git
   cd ClickTrace-tool
   ```

2. Install the necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Place the JavaScript files you want to analyze in the `test/` directory.
   - You can organize files in subdirectories if needed, the tool will recursively scan all `.js` files.
   
2. Run the tool:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. The tool will:
   - Parse the JavaScript files in `test/`.
   - Build a call graph.
   - Output all possible function call sequences in the console.

### Example Output

```bash
Parsing controller.js...
Parsing model.js...
Parsing view.js...

Call Graph: {
  "initializeUserSession": ["fetchUserData"],
  "fetchUserData": ["validateData"],
  "validateData": [],
  ...
}

All Possible Function Call Sequences:
Sequence 1: initializeUserSession -> fetchUserData -> validateData
```

### Testing a Real-World MVC App

ClickTrace has been tested on various JavaScript apps, including a complex MVC-based app. It successfully analyzed functions across **models**, **views**, and **controllers**, and generated call graphs for the entire application.

### Project Structure

```bash
clicktrace-tool/
├── lib/                # Core library code
│   ├── astParser.js    # AST parsing and call graph logic
├── test/               # Directory where you place your JS files to be analyzed
│   └── ...             # Your JavaScript files (or subfolders)
├── index.js            # Main entry point to run the tool
├── package.json        # NPM dependencies
└── README.md           # Project documentation
```

### Roadmap

- **Handle Module Imports/Exports**: Follow imports across files to build a more accurate call graph.
- **Support for More Complex Syntax**: Extend support for dynamic function calls and advanced JavaScript patterns.
- **GUI Version**: Consider developing a web-based or visual interface for easier interaction.
